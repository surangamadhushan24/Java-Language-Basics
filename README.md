# Java-Language-Basics

_Exercise 1_: Calculator Program Write a program that takes two numbers and an operator 
(+, -, *, /) as command-line arguments , performs the operation, and prints the result. 
Use proper naming conventions, variables, data types (including primitives), and comments.
Handle division by zero with a custom message.

_Exercise 2_: Pass-by-Value Experiment Create a method that attempts to swap two integers and two objects
(e.g., a custom Point class). 
Demonstrate how Java handles pass-by-value for primitives and references by printing values before and after
the swap attempt.

_Exercise 3_: Number Guessing Game Build a game where the computer generates a random number between 1 and 100, and the user guesses it.
Use if-else for hints ("too high" or "too low"), a while loop for repeated guesses, and break when the user wins.
Add a switch to let the user choose difficulty (e.g., number of allowed guesses).

_Exercise 3_:Prime Number Checker Write a program to check if a number is prime using a for loop and the ternary operator to print "Prime" or "Not Prime".
Use continue to skip unnecessary iterations and a labeled break to exit early if needed.
