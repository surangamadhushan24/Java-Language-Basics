# Java-Language-Basics

_Exercise 1_: Calculator Program Write a program that takes two numbers and an operator 
(+, -, *, /) as command-line arguments , performs the operation, and prints the result. 
Use proper naming conventions, variables, data types (including primitives), and comments.
Handle division by zero with a custom message.

_Exercise 2_: Pass-by-Value Experiment Create a method that attempts to swap two integers and two objects
(e.g., a custom Point class). 
Demonstrate how Java handles pass-by-value for primitives and references by printing values before and after
the swap attempt.
